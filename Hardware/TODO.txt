- create 3D models 

- rename proejct to uSDX Transceiver SMD
- buy a 12V power source 
- make sure all used libraries can be easily transferred
    - how to easily transfer footprints and 3D models without reconfiguring the paths 
- download all the datasheets

- order copper wire for toroids 
- order support pins for PCB
- order good quality male and female pins for the BPF boards


- verfy everything again
